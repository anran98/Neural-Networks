# Input Normalization

This repository contains a Python function for normalizing input data using z-score normalization. This process rescales the features of the data to have a mean (`μ`) of 0 and a standard deviation (`σ`) of 1, which is commonly required for many machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Column-wise normalization of input data.
- Uses z-score normalization technique.
- Includes an epsilon value to prevent division by zero.

## Requirements

This code requires Python to run and uses the `numpy` library for numerical operations.
