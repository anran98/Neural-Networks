# Deep Neural Network Implementation

This project contains an implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) with L2 regularization and Dropout to prevent overfitting.

## Features

- **L2 Regularization**: Penalizes the square values of the weights in the loss function, encouraging the network to learn small weights.
- **Dropout**: Randomly drops units (along with their connections) during the training phase, which helps the network to generalize better.
