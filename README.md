# Deep Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) with customizable layers. The DNN is built from scratch using NumPy and includes features such as forward propagation, cost function evaluation, and backpropagation for learning.

## Features

- Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax, and Linear
- Forward Propagation: Calculates the output of the neural network for a given input
- Cost Function: Computes the cross-entropy loss
- Backpropagation: Performs gradient descent to update network parameters

```bash
pip install numpy
```
